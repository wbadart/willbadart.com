# Double-entry Accounting

An accounting technique that models transactions as collections of two or more
credits and/ or debits.

Debits add value to "debit normal" and remove value from "credit normal" accounts, while credits add value to credit normal accounts and remove it from debit normal accounts.

Debit normal accounts contain "owned" value (e.g. a checking account) or uses of value (e.g. an expense account).
Credit normal accounts contain "owed" value (e.g. liabilities like credit cards and loan balances) or sources of value (e.g. revenue, equity).

**Within each transaction, the sum total of credit entries must equal the sum total of debit entries.**
If credits are "where money came from" and debits are "where money went," this _balance_ property ensures all value is accounted for.

For example:

```hledger
2022-08-24 bought groceries
    credit card     CREDIT USD 10
    expenses:food   DEBIT  USD 10


2022-08-30 paid credit card balance
    credit card     DEBIT  USD 10
    checking        CREDIT USD 10
```

The value in each account can be computed from the list of transactions.
