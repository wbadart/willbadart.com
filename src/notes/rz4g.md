# Eisenhower Matrix

An Eisenhower Matrix is a framework for prioritizing tasks:

|             | Important | Not Important |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| Urgent      | Do        | Schedule      |
| Not Urgent  | Delegate  | Delete        |

**Do** things with deadlines or consequences that require your personal attention.
**Delegate** things with deadlines or consequences that don't require your particular skills or personal attention.
**Schedule** things without deadlines but which contribute to long-term success.
**Delete** distractions and unnecessary tasks.
