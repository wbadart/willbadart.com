# UNPHAT (You Are Not Google)

When evaluating technologies:

- **Understand** the problem you're trying to solve
- **eNumerate** the candidate solutions
- For each candidate:
    - Read the **Paper** if there is one
    - Determine the **Historical context** of the candidate solution
    - Weigh the **Advantages** and determine what was deprioritized to achieve them
    - **Think** about how well it solves the problem. 
        - > What fact would need to be different for you to change your mind? For instance, how much smaller would the data need to be before you'd elect not to use Hadoop?
